Gezure-Android
==============

Gezure-Android is a part of the Gezure project. It is an android app that lets users connect their Myo Gesture Control Armband to their android devices and use it like a remote.
The app categorizes the different kind of videos that the user watches into buckets. For example, a student like me will have all online courseware in a bucket, movies in another bucket, songs in another bucket and so and so forth.
The app will give recommended videos for each bucket.

A user can use his/her Myo armband to play, pause, switch between vidoes, buckets, switch between devices. For instance, if you are playing a video on a mobile phone and would like to view the same vide on a tab or a tv for instance, you could just do it using a pre defined gesture.
The app will open up in other device and start playing the video from the exactly where you had stopped watching.

This was a Hack Project made at HackSC. A demo and details of the app can be found here: http://hackscfall2014.challengepost.com/submissions/29709-gezure
